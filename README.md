# Laughter is the best medicine
Barkat Meghaney, my late elder brother, wrote jokes.  I compiled them and published a book in his name as author, titled as "Laughter is the best Medicine".

When was the last time you had really a good laugh?  Laughter is the best medicine.  It is a reminder to everybody that as children, we used to laugh hundreds of times a day, but as adults, life tends to be more serious resulting in infrequent laughter. 

Seek out more opportunities for humour and laughter in your life. You will find your emotional health improving, your relationships strengthening, and you will find greater happiness - and even add years to your life.

This book was written by my late elder brother Barkat Ali Meghaney during the global social era of 1970's and 1980's. It was the time when radio programmes were the chief entertaining medium for people of all ages. TV was a new entrant in the homes of rich people only. People loved hand-written letters of pen-friends and collected postage stamps. People loved to listen and sing popular songs.

So, dive into that era when people were fond of popular English song 'San Francisco' sung by Scott McKenzie in 
your imagination and enjoy the real taste of humour of that time.  Happy reading.
